# Contributing

Please note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with this project.

Pie for Providers' [open issues are here](https://github.com/pieforproviders/pieforproviders/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22ready+for+work%22). We'll tag issues that would make a good first pull request for new contributors. 

An easy way to get started helping the project is to *file an issue*. You can do that on the Pie for Providers' issues page by clicking on the green button at the right. Issues can include bugs to fix, features to add, or documentation that looks outdated. 

Contributions to Pie for Providers should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. When contributing to this repository with a pull request, please fill the pull request template out as completely as is reasonable. Each pull request will be reviewed by a core contributor (someone with permission to merge) and either merged into `develop` or given feedback for requested changes.

## Workflow

When you start working on an issue:
[ ] assign the ticket to yourself  
[ ] visit the [project board](https://github.com/pieforproviders/pieforproviders/projects/1) and pull the ticket into "In Progress"  

## Pull Request Checklist

[ ] Branch from the develop branch and, if needed, rebase to the current develop branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with develop you may be asked to rebase your changes.  
[ ] Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should pass tests and linters).  
[ ] When updating dependencies, please explain _why_ the update is necessary.  
[ ] If your PR is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-tag a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment.  
[ ] Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
